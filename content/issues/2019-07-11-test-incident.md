*Resolved* -
We believe GitHub URLs are now working as expected. {{< track "2019-07-11 16:35:00" >}}

<!-- *Monitoring* - We believe the connectivity issues are being caused by an isolated ISP issue. We've had reports that swapping to Google DNS servers (see here; https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using) resolves the problem for users. {{< track "2018-05-25 04:40:00" >}} -->

*Investigating* - This is just a test incident. DON'T PANIC. {{< track "2019-07-11 11:53:00" >}}
